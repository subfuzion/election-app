This repo contains a demo Election App. The purpose of this repo is to
highlight how to:

- Write an application and incrementally modernize it to run on [Google Cloud].
- Use Cloud Code, a Google extension that assists you in the IDE. From within the IDE, you will learn to:

  - Build and deploy to [GKE] using [Cloud Deploy].
  - Build and deploy to [Cloud Run] using [Cloud Build].
  - Assess application performance through logging and monitoring using [Cloud Ops].
