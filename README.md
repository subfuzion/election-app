# Election App

This repo contains a demo Election App. The purpose of this repo is to
highlight how to:

- Write an application and incrementally modernize it to run on [Google Cloud].
- Use [Cloud Code], a Google extension that assists you in the IDE. From within the IDE, you will learn to:

  - Create a GKE cluster in Autopilot mode
  - Build and deploy to [GKE] and [Cloud Run] using [Cloud Build].
  - Monitor your deployment, view application logs, and use the IDE to stop on breakpoints in the editor to debug your running app.
